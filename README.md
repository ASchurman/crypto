This project implements the AES algorithm.
**This was done for fun. Obviously don't use any of this code in any security-critical application!**

For now, only AES-128 in ECB mode is implemented. And currently, there isn't any ability to actually use this program to encrypt or decrypt files; it only runs the tests!
